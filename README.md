# Bayesian estimation of heavy-tail densities
This repository to estimate prior and posterior laws  in order to create a density that takes into account heavy-tail distribution and does not shrink high outliers.

We take our main framework from the article : *On Global-Local Shrinkage Priors for Count Data* of Y. Hamura, K. Irie and S. Sugasawa

R code is drawn from : https://github.com/sshonosuke/GLSP-count
