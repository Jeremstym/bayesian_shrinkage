# Bayesian estimation of heavy-tail densities
This repository to estimate prior and posterior laws  in order to create a density that takes into account heavy-tail distribution and does not shrink high outliers.

We take our main framework from the article : *On Global-Local Shrinkage Priors for Count Data* of Y. Hamura, K. Irie and S. Sugasawa

R code is drawn from : https://github.com/sshonosuke/GLSP-count

Clone the repository with the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeremstym/bayesian_shrinkage.git
```
Or download the zip from the [github](https://github.com/Jeremstym/bayesian_shrinkage) and unzip it where you want.
